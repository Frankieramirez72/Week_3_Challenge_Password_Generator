# Week_3_Challenge_Password_Generator
This website should give a list of options to create a random password.

This is the Module 3 challenge in the UCB Coding Bootcamp's third week. We were tasked with creating a JavaScript code to generate a password based on user specifications. The code utilizes variables, if statements, for loops, and default methods/functions like alert, prompt, confirm, and random generators. It builds a custom character database and returns a random password to the user through alerts and webpage display.
